# An Extra 100 Ideas for Computing

Some ideas I thought of that I enjoyed thinking about and writing down.

* [100 Ideas for Computing](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas)
* [Another 85+ Ideas for Computing](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas2)

# 1. Community Idea: Peer naming

Reading code that uses awful names is painful. We could improve the code we write by collecting peer contributed and voted names.

# 2. Ultra monolith

A web based framework codebase that everyone shares the same codebase for. Allows optimisations by people to benefit everyone simultaneously.

# 3. Nested search

Applications advertise that they can be searched. When you activate the system wide search, a subquery is made for each application. So on Android, a search for an application that is not installed will create a query onto the Play store amongst a web search with the browser.

# 4. Search Integrated Programming Language

A langauge with search built-in: any use of an undefined symbol causes a lookup request to a server that monitors library packages for exports. When a symbol is found, it is downloaded for the system for use as library code.

See [importless lang for a proof of concept with Python](https://github.com/samsquire/importless-lang)

# 5. Forum powered desktop

A [deep lever](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas2#99-deep-lever--testing-in-the-field) into desktop applications that is powered by a web forum.

# 6. Bandwidth chargers

Billing for users of bandwidth from services like AWS. So open source projects could create high data transfer services.

# 7. Visual re-flow invalidation

Not all layers of a GUI need to re-drawn during a layout change. This idea is to visually map physical regions on the screen to code blocks. If there's no change to the code of these blocks, the divider doesn't need to be re-rendered.

# 8. Flat HTML

Write HTML with a flat data structure to avoid nested editing and to stream data more efficiently.

See my repository https://github.com/samsquire/flat-html

# 9. Self perpetuating desktop

Without downloading additional packages, a Linux distribution that can also run as a continuous integration server and build server. This means that the desktop can build .ISOs to distribute itself.

# 10. Time language

Function Mesh

# Visual paging

# Latency language

Place data in different boxes.

# Data suction

Flow control

# Notes

literate programming story introduce test case all together

Things written as communication protocols are easier to program and reason about. Concurrency too (see go and occam pi)
Turn the GUI into a communication problem.

Permutations and validity.

A data structure that represents a forum or a blog that can be rendered into a CRUD app.
