# An Extra 100 Ideas for Computing

Some ideas I thought of that I enjoyed thinking about and writing down.

* [100 Ideas for Computing](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas)
* [Another 85+ Ideas for Computing](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas2)

# 1. Community Idea: Peer naming

Reading code that uses awful names is painful. We could improve the code we write by collecting peer contributed and voted names.

# 2. Ultra monolith

A web based framework codebase that everyone shares the same codebase for. Allows optimisations by people to benefit everyone simultaneously.

# 3. Nested search

Applications advertise that they can be searched. When you activate the system wide search, a subquery is made for each application. So on Android, a search for an application that is not installed will create a query onto the Play store amongst a web search with the browser.

# 4. Search Integrated Programming Language

A langauge with search built-in: any use of an undefined symbol causes a lookup request to a server that monitors library packages for exports. When a symbol is found, it is downloaded for the system for use as library code.

See [importless lang for a proof of concept with Python](https://github.com/samsquire/importless-lang)

# 5. Forum powered desktop

A deep lever into desktop applications that is powered by a web forum.

# Notes

literate programming story introduce test case all together

Things written as communication protocols are easier to program and reason about. Concurrency too (see go and occam pi)
Turn the GUI into a communication problem.

Permutations and validity.
