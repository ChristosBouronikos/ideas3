# 1. Community Idea: Peer naming

Reading code that uses awful names is painful. We could improve the code we write by collecting peer contributed and voted names.

# 2. Ultra monolith

A web based framework codebase that everyone shares the same codebase for. Allows optimisations by people to benefit everyone simultaneously.

# Notes

literate programming story introduce test case all together

Things written as communication protocols are easier to program and reason about. Concurrency too (see go and occam pi)
Turn the GUI into a communication problem.

Permutations and validity.
